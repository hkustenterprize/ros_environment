# Extrinsic parameter between IMU and Camera.
estimate_extrinsic: 0   # 0  Have an accurate extrinsic parameters. We will trust the following imu^R_cam, imu^T_cam, don't change it.
                        # 1  Have an initial guess about extrinsic parameters. We will optimize around your initial guess.
                        # 2  Don't know anything about extrinsic parameters. You don't need to give R,T. We will try to calibrate it. Do some rotation movement at beginning.                        
#If you choose 0 or 1, you should write down the following matrix.

#optimization parameters
max_solver_time: 0.04  # max solver itration time (ms), to guarantee real time
max_num_iterations: 8   # max solver itrations, to guarantee real time
keyframe_parallax: 10.0 # keyframe selection threshold (pixel)

#imu parameters       The more accurate parameters you provide, the better performance
